#Why SmartOS

This is a presentation I gave regarding SmartOS and why I was advocating using it. It's just HTML + JavaScript. View it with any simple web server. 

The easiest way view is to run the following from the root dir:

`
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
`

Then surf to:

http://localhost:8000/smartos
